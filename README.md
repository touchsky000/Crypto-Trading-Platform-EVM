### Zero Sum Position AMM (ZSPM) Algorithm

The ZSPM algorithm is designed to maintain a balanced market by ensuring that the total value of all positions remains constant. This approach helps in minimizing risks and optimizing price decisions. The algorithm continuously monitors market conditions and adjusts positions accordingly to maintain equilibrium.

**How ZSPM Works:**

1. **Real-time Market Monitoring**: Continuously fetches real-time market data to assess current market conditions.
2. **Position Adjustment**: Automatically adjusts positions based on market fluctuations to maintain a zero-sum balance.
3. **Risk Management**: Integrates risk management strategies to protect against adverse market movements.
